Demo applications to test with various tools
Note - I uploaded these files via the GitHub GUI.. I recommend running ``dos2unix`` or similar before ``vagrant up`` just in case.

1. Configure memory and CPU in vagrant file
1. Configure vagrant_vars.yaml as appropriate
1. Check flags at the start of bootstrap.sh
1. ``vagrant up``
1. See script output for accessible URLs
